                <h3>Elementary and Middle School: St. Patricia School</h3>
                <p>I went to St. Patricia School from kindergarten to 8th grade. I was there for a very long time and played soccer, basketball, and football.</p>
                <h3>High School: Amos Alonzo Stagg</h3>
                <p>I then attended Amos Alonzo Stagg. I was in high school from 2017-2021. Covid hit during the 2nd semester of junior year. We went online for the 3 remaining semesters.</p>
                <h3>College: University of Iowa</h3>
                <p>I came to the University of Iowa in 2021. I plan to graduate in 2025, but I want to pursue the MAC so I will stay for an extra year.</p>
